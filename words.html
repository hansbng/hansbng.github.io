    <h2>
      To throw an egg
    </h2>

    <p>
      To egg someone on stage is to call them a failure. 
      It’s to make a mess and inconvenience their day, to make known and public that in your eyes, 
      the performer failed you. Cracked eggs are cruel. 
      A yolk and white drawn out of their shell to insult, 
      the shell an insult to the insult. An egg is one force, 
      but once broken it is two, or three. All cruel, all cracked now. </p>

    <p>
      An un-thrown egg, on the other hand, is joyful. 
      It is a sign of life, of food, of joy. It is round and yet it sits peacefully. 
      It is brown or white or colored, and sometimes spotted, sometimes polka dotted, 
      sometimes patterned. Quail eggs are comically tiny, ostrich eggs are comically large. E
      normous! Gigantic! But never catastrophic. Because eggs find peace where it seems impossible. 
      They are balls that have stretched to stop rolling, ovular shapes that do well on oblique 
      planes so long as those planes are finite. For eggs are happy because they are continuous yet stagnant. 
      To symbolize life and sit well in a carton of a dozen more is a kind of juxtaposition we don’t appreciate 
      as much as we should.
    </p>

    <p>
      I love eggs. I love their roundness and imperfections and how birds must sit on them because the future babies evolve from the warmth. I love their humor,
      because there’s a reason why they have broken world records on instagram, why we think 
      they’re so peculiar yet they’re used in most dishes. I love the pulped paper cartons 
      they sit in that we used to use for arts and crafts. I love that when snakes swallow 
      them, they are indestructible. When we step on many of them they do not crack, because 
      they’ve somehow learned that force can be perfectly distributed across their little egg heads. 
      And I love how they can become a weapon; not that they should, but that something so peaceful is also so formidable. That. Is. Inspired.
    </p>
