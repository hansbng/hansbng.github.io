    <p> When I was a junior in high school, I repainted my room to green (a very similar shade
        to this website) with my cousin Jessica. One wall remained white with some green accent
        stripes. With an excess of white paint, I felt an impulse to color a large oval facing
        the white wall. After a couple months, I began pinning and taping random pieces of paper,
        stickers, and photos within the oval. I also began to introduce the wall as a wall of 
        "failures and accomplishments." Herein lies many representations of events, experiences,
        and memories that have shaped me into who I am. Things I feel immensely proud of,
        and things I learned from. </p>
